<h1>Tuberculosis</h1>

<b>Witness our rules: </b>

<i>
	In a wasteland, a city lies. The proletariat labor to forge an existence.
A dead world, consuming itself and festering with rot. Cruelty and malice are the fuel that continues to prolong the inevitable fate of the weak flesh.

			No matter how much they work, the rot consumes all.
