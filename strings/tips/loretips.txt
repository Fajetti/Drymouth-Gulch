The world is dead. The Rot consumes all.
Despair is perspective.
Beyond the city lies nothing material, nothing worth dying for.
Some have attempted to sail the waters to the beyond. None have returned.
There are those amoungst the populace who dare to destroy the city from within its stewardship.
Agents of Cruelty appear eradicate to the hope of those who threaten the cycle.
Let failure not sway your conviction, nor fear.
